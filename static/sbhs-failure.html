		<h1>"SBHS took too long"</h1>
		This message can occur for a number of reasons - basically it means that the SBHS portal could not be contacted.<br />
		The most common causes will be:
		<ul>
			<li>Planned maintenance at SBHS - often there will be a post <a href="https://student.sbhs.net.au">on the portal</a> warning you before it happens (normally happens over weekends or holidays)</li>
			<li>A buggy or broken <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy">reverse proxy</a>, which can mean that the wider internet cannot access the school intranet (although you might be able to if you're at school)</li>
			<li>A power outage at SBHS</li>
			<li>An internet outage at SBHS</li>
		</ul>
