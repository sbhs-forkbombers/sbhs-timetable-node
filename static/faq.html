	Congratulations - you've reached SBHSTimetable.tk v2.0!<br /><br />
	<h2>What's new?</h2>
	<hr />
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Security</strong> &mdash; Now you don't have to type in your timetable - or even give us your identity. All we get is a single token that allows us to retrieve data on your behalf and display it to you.<br />We can't store or log your data, so only you and the people sitting behind you can see it.</li>
		<li><strong>Simplicity</strong> &mdash; It's been rewritten from the ground up using the same engine as Google Chrome, to be faster, smaller and more efficient.</li>
		<li><strong>Real-time updates</strong> &mdash; Got a room change? Or maybe a casual? It'll show up here!</li>
	</ol>
	All these good things, and if you're curious about how your data is handled, or want to contribute, you can take a look at the code which can be found <a href="https://github.com/sbhs-forkbombers/sbhs-timetable-node">here</a>.<br /><br />
	<h2>Have you got an app?</h2>
	<hr />
	Why, yes we do. You may find it on the Play Store <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sbhstimetable.sbhs_timetable_android">here</a>.
	<br /><br /><br />
	<h2>What about an iOS app?</h2>
	<hr />
	Unfortunately, neither of us own an iOS device, nor are we willing or able to pay the US$99/year iOS Developer Program fee. However, if you're up for the challenge, feel free to go for it.
	<br /><br /><br />
	<h2>Why is the icon so horrible?</h2>
	<hr />
	Something about trademark infringement. Anyway, if you want to create a better icon, feel free to email it to us at <br /><a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="window.location='mailto:sbhstimetable@gmail.com'">sbhstimetable &gt;at&lt; <span style="display:none">hey there hacker this is an email address</span>gmail &gt;dot&lt; com</a>.<br />We would like images 512x512 pixels or higher (vector graphics files - SVGs/Adobe Illustrator documents/etc - are preferred)
	<br /><br /><br />
